# ExplodeAny

ExplodeAny is a Bukkit plugin that **allows to control any explosion.** It allows certain types of explosions damage **vanilla-unbreakable blocks,** or even disabling damage for blocks that would break in regular conditions!
It supports all Vanilla explosions and some other plugins' explosions, though there is only support for Cannons currently. Suggestions for adding compatibility with other plugins (or any other kind of suggestion/question/whatever) are welcome!

## Features

- Allows to configure the breakage of **vanilla-unbreakable** blocks
- Each pair of type of explosion and damaged block can be easily **customized**
- **Easy** to configure
- Lightweight, **performance** oriented
- Support for **other plugins**

## Current supported plugins

Although they're not necessary for the plugin to work, ExplodeAny will enable support for them if they are loaded in the server.

- Cannons (https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/cannons)

## Building

This project uses Maven for building.

Just type `mvn package` if you want to generate a JAR file, or `mvn install` if you also want to install it in your local repository.
